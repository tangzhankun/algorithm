 *The task is to design and implement methods of an LRU cache.
 * The class has two methods get and set which are defined as follows.
 * get(x)   : Gets the value of the key x if the key exists in the cache otherwise returns -1
 * set(x,y) : inserts the value if the key x is not already present. If the cache reaches its capacity it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting the new item.
 * In the constructor of the class the size of the cache should be intitialized.
